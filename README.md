# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project 

 This is the Repository for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project
 This contains R-Code (Analysis), codebook, and the tidy data set for the project
	
 Codebook.Rd describes how to use the analysis through explaining the data, the variables of the data, and the work that was done to tidy up the data. 

	# run_analysis.R
	# This contains the commented code delineated in the 5 steps for the project
	# 5 steps
	# 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	# 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	# 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	# 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	# 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

	# The final output is new_tidy_data_final.txt!
