# This is the code book for the Week4 Getting and Cleaning Data Project

# To get new_tidy_data_final.txt Run the run_analysis.R script! (The first few lines deal with downloading the data necessary!)

# Regarding the Source Data
The data comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, to find a full description of this work, 
Follow this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data for the project is here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Info on The variables for this project

##### This is directly from the README in UCI HAR Dataset as it describes the variables
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## Info for run_analysis.R script
This R script has a few part, it's purpose is to complete the five steps of the project described in the Readme. 

The sections of the R-Code are listed below, with the assumption that the files needed are in the same location - w/ data uncompressed
 #1 Merging training and test sets to create one data set
  1.1 set up pathway
	1.2 double check to make sure everything is there   
  1.3 Read in training datasets               
  1.4 Read in testing datasets
  1.5 Read in Features 
  1.6 Read in activity labels
  1.7 Looking at activity/features + description - easier to assign names now
  1.8 Actually Merge

#2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  2.1 Check column names
  2.2 Make our vector for Defining activity_id, subject_id, mean, std
  2.3 Subsetting data

#3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set	

#4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
		### look in 1.7 and 2.2/2.3
    
#5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
  5.1 creating a second tidy set of data
	5.2 Writing the output to txt file
