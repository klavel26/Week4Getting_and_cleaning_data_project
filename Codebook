# This is the code book for the Week4 Getting and Cleaning Data Project

# To get new_tidy_data_final.txt Run the run_analysis.R script! (The first few lines deal with downloading the data necessary!)

# Regarding the Source Data
The data comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, to find a full description of this work, 
Follow this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data for the project is here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Info on The variables for this project
Xtrain, ytrain, subject_train, Xtest, ytest, subject_test are the variables that contain the downloaded datasets
features and activity_labels contain the descriptions of the data in the above datasets. 

## Info for run_analysis.R script
This R script has a few part, it's purpose is to complete the five steps of the project described in the Readme. 

The sections of the R-Code are listed below, with the assumption that the files needed are in the same location - w/ data uncompressed
 #1 Merging training and test sets to create one data set
  1.1 set up pathway
	1.2 double check to make sure everything is there   
  1.3 Read in training datasets               
  1.4 Read in testing datasets
  1.5 Read in Features 
  1.6 Read in activity labels
  1.7 Looking at activity/features + description - easier to assign names now
  1.8 Actually Merge

#2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  2.1 Check column names
  2.2 Make our vector for Defining activity_id, subject_id, mean, std
  2.3 Subsetting data

#3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set	

#4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
		### look in 1.7 and 2.2/2.3
    
#5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
  5.1 creating a second tidy set of data
	5.2 Writing the output to txt file
